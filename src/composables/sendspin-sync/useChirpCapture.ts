 * inside the capture worklet, and that counter only means anything while the
 * graph it belongs to stays up — reopening the microphone per speaker would leave
 * each recording on its own time base with nothing to relate them.
 *
 * Recording is armed and disarmed around each speaker, which is not the same
 * thing. The audio graph runs throughout and the frame counter never stops; all
 * disarming does is stop shipping samples to the main thread. Hearing nothing
 * while walking between rooms is expected and simply contributes no arrivals.
 *
 * A suspended context voids the run. There is no absolute anchor to recover
 * from: once the audio clock has stopped, arrivals recorded before the gap and
 * after it cannot be placed on one timeline, and the only honest response is to
 * say so and start again.
