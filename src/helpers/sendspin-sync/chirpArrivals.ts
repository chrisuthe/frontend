/**
 * Pulling every chirp arrival out of one speaker's recording.
 *
 * A recording covers several chirp periods, and the chirps inside it are spaced
 * by the server's clock rather than the phone's — so their positions are
 * predictable but not exactly known. Each one is located in its own narrow
 * window instead of by scanning the whole recording, which keeps the tail of the
 * previous chirp out of the search: in a reverberant room that tail can still be
 * loud enough half a second later to be taken for an arrival.
 *
 * The windows are placed from the loudest thing in the recording. That is
 * certainly a real chirp — whether the direct sound or a reflection of it — so
 * its position modulo the period is a reliable guide to where the others sit,
 * and the first-peak rule inside each window is what then picks the direct
 * arrival out from its own reflections.
