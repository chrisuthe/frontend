/**
 * A whole walk, from the capture worklet through to the fitted latencies, with
 * render quanta dropped in the middle of it.
 *
 * The failure this reproduces came back at -6868 ppm with every speaker
 * scattering 13-15 ms, from a three speaker walk whose second leg was a long one
 * upstairs. Nothing was wrong with the speakers: the phone stalled while it was
 * being carried, and a capture that timed arrivals by counting the frames it had
 * been handed closed that stall up, timing every arrival after it early by the
 * length of the stall and numbering a whole burst onto the wrong chirp.
 *
 * So this covers the seam rather than any one unit. The worklet numbers batches,
 * `assemble` turns those numbers into a timeline, `scanArrivals` reads arrivals
 * off it and `fitLatencies` reads a clock rate and one offset per speaker off
 * those — and the stall is only visible if every one of them is honest about it.
 * Each stage is the real one; only the microphone and the audio thread are not.
